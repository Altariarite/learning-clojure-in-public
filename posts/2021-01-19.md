# Tidying up

My journey towards lisp enlightenment began one summer day. I browsed through 'How to Design Programs', 'The Land of Lisp','Hackers and Painters', and many more. I worked through first pratical steps in [A road to Common Lisp](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/) and find pairs of parenthesis attractive.

Later, I found out [Why RoamResearch uses Clojure](https://mobile.twitter.com/Conaw/status/1176276601048199168) and decided to move to Clojure. By doing exercises in 'Living Clojure', I got into the flow of using VSCode and Calva, shuffling parenthesis around using Paredit. It was at this time I encountered ClojureFam.

## Looking Ahead

All my endeavours were all little pieces of basic functions floating around. I've thought of getting involved in an open-source project but the idea intimidated me. ClojureFam provides the excellent opportunity for a gradual involvement, and I am instantly convinced. 

Today my work was mainly trying to match what I know with the progress tracker of ClojureFam. I skipped through the first few chapters of 'Clojure from the Ground Up' and counted the problems done on 4Clojure. 1 hour spent plus writing this article.

I plan to spend another hour looking into some of the advanced topic and do another day of training 'Living Clojure'

The journey begins!
