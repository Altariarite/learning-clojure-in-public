# Minimal Clojurescript

Until now I have been unfamiliar with the actual workings of a clojurescript project. Usually my workflow involve various libraries: lein creates a project for me, which has
shadow-cljs included. I then jack-in the repl using calva. Everything works like magic, but what's really happening?

With the help of https://clojurescript.org/guides/quick-start I was able to start a clojurescript project from the bare minimum. Just 3 things: a namespace folder, a main file and a deps.edn file for dependencies.

The directory looks like the following:
```
hello-world        # Our project folder
├─ src             # The CLJS source code for our project
│  └─ hello_world  # Our hello_world namespace folder
│     └─ core.cljs # Our main file
└─ deps.edn        # (macOS/Linux only) A file for listing our dependencies
```

If we run the command `clj -M --main cljs.main --compile hello-world.core --repl`, the cljs file is compiled to out/main.js with other dependencies. This is roughly the same as what's happening under the hood when we are doing calva jack-in with `deps.edn and built-in Clojurescript Browser Repl`

Now that I know this, it becomes clear how to use plain hiccup and js interop to write apps. What I need is to `(.querySelector js/document "body")`, and replace innerHTML using hiccup.
Calva has a getting started instruction on how to do this:
```clojurescript
(-> js/document
  (.getElementById "app") ;;=> DOM object
  (.-innerHTML) ;;=> HTML content, a string
  (set! "") ;;=> set the string to something else)
```

Tomorrow I will try to build a digital clock. This should be using a bunch of JS interop like `Date`, `setInterval`, etc.
