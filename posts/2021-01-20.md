> Delays *defer* evaluation, and futures *parallelize* it.

### Future

> futures are evaluated in a new *thread*. On multicore computers, two threads can run in *parallel*, on different cores the same time.

A very simple example of messy parallel using `future`:

```clojure
user=> (dotimes [i 5] (prn i))
0
1
2
3
4
nil
user=> (dotimes [i 5] (future (prn i)))
0
2
1
34

nil
```

The thread writing 3 didn't get to print newline before 4 showed up, then both threads wrote new lines at the same time. 

>There are techniques to control this concurrent execution so that things happen in some well-defined sequence, like agents and locks, but weâ€™ll  discuss those later.
