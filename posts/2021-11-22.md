Today I read the logistics chapter of Clojure from the Ground Up. It describes basic operations with the leiningen tool of clojure. Also it has examples stitching together json to do some data exploring using clojure's higher order functions. 
Nothing too fancy. 

I also found some cool looking things in https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning, but the scope is a bit too big I think for my current level.

Therefore, I went on to solve some more 4clojure problems and read the debugging chapter (which is a very good read and not specific to clojure)
