# learning-clojure-in-public


Trying to [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu) and stay on a 35 day streak. Logging my progress and thoughts from learning ClojureFam.

Also tracking my progress through https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/issues/100
